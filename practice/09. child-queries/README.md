# Try it yourself - Child Queries

## 1. Using view query
In the [`app.component.ts`](./src/app/app.component.ts) file, find instructions for the first challenge. There is an input on the screen, and a button. Clicking the button should automatically select all the text inside the input

## 2. Using content query
In the [`components/input-manager/input-manager.component.ts`](./src/app/components/input-manager/input-manager.component.ts) file, find instructions for the second challenge. When clicking the button, clear all the inputs that are projected into the input manager component. 
>Hint: to make querying the content easier, we have added a "managed-input" directive.
